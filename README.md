# `debugadapter`

An implementation of the [Debug Adapter
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) for R

> **Status**
>
> On hiatus. The most actionable outcome is that this work requires a new
> `pre-task-callback` in R, allowing for syncing the debug state before
> running R code. Without this, the debugger state will lag behind an
> R session by one top-level call.
>
> Working around this limitation introduced more complexity to the project
> than I care to try to tackle at this time.

`debugadapter` operates in one of two ways:

1. `execute` mode, where A file is used as a script for execution, in which
   case `debugadapter` will launch a new debug server, register breakpoints and
   provide a debug `REPL` within your client if it provides the capability and
   allow you to step through the script (not currently implemented).

2. `attach` mode, where your client will attach to a running server, running
   as a background process to an interactive session.

   ```r
   # start a server in the background
   debugadapter::run()

   # execute some code which will hit a breakpoint and debug as usual
   my_code_to_debug()
   # debugging at my_nested_fn_call(...) #123
   # Browse[0]>
   # ...
   ```

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to launch your debug server, then follow the
instructions for your [client of choice](#clients).

**1. Installation**

```r
pak::pkg_install("dgkf/debugadapter")
```

**2. Starting the Server**

Regardless of your client, running a server is always the same. In `R`, run:

```r
debugadapter::run()
```

For testing or development, you may consider setting the option
`debugadapter.log` to configure the log level. One of `1` (trace),
`2` (debug) or `3` (info - default).

**3. Set a Breakpoint**

From your IDE's `DAP` client, set a breakpoint. See a list of [client
instructions](#clients) below to configure your IDE.

> Not that debugging breakpoints aren't recognized from the R session until
> after the next top-level command finishes (see #4 for details).

**4. Debug!**

:construction: Work-in-progress :construction:

Currently, nothing will happen. Communication about the current debugger state
back to the client is in early development.

The intention is that debugging within the running R session relays information
about the current state of the debugger back to your debug client so that the
current scope and environment are communicated back to your client as you step
through your code.

Likewise, using your IDE's debug controls to step through code progress
debugging on the R session.

### Clients

#### neovim (`nvim-dap`)

We first need to provide neovim with instructions for attaching to a running R
session when we activate a debugger (most often with a a `:DapContinue` command)

Within your `nvim` configuration files:

```lua
local dap = require('dap')

dap.adapters.r = {
  type = 'server',
  port = 18721,  -- needs to match `debugadapter::run()`'s `port` argument
  executable = {
      command = "R",
      args = { "--slave", "-e", "debugadapter::run()" },
  },
}

dap.configurations.r = {
  {
    type = 'r',
    request = 'attach',
    name = 'Attach session'
  }
}
```

## Architecture

Attaching an interactive R session relies on the coordination of
multiple R processes:

1. **DAP Server**  
   A socket-based server used for communicating with the debug client.
   When run in the background, the debugger state is synchronized after
   each top-level task and before entering a REPL-based debugger.

1. **R Session**  
   The interactive R session serves as the parent to the DAP server and
   the `browser()` REPL, allowing for iterative debugging in a persistent
   R session.

1. **forked `browser()` process**  
   When `browser()` would be called, it is instead launched in a forked
   process, which allows the interactive R session to step through the
   debugger while also querying for various debugger context required
   by the debug client. Unfortunately, this means that this approach is
   currently not supported on Windows.

### Debugging Loop

        r->>dap: update server state
        dap->>ide: update client state
    end

    alt Client-based stepping
        ide->>dap: step request
        dap->>r: step signal
        r->>b: step signal
    else REPL-based stepping
        r->>-b: stdin
    end
end
```

This is all orchestrated using a web of connections between each
of the processes. The exact layout is in flux as the project matures.

### The _Shadow_ Browser

The "shadow" browser ("shadow" here in the vein of the "shadow DOM"
in the web world - a mirror of the current, displayed environment
for managing state) is a `dapr`-specific browser prompt, which
executes additional code in the background to synchronize debugger
state with a client. Since the `browser()` prompt is rather rigidly
defined in the internals of the R language, the way this works is
messy to say the least.

When active, `stdin` and `stdout` are redirected to a child process.
User commands are sent back to the parent process's `stdin` and
the output is sent back to the parent using `stderr` (using messages)
Additional calls are made to inspect the state of the debugger after
each step and to send this information to the client. These calls
are omitted from the output that is relayed back to the parent.

A task callback is used to restore the original `stdin` and `stdout`,
and to close all the connections used to communicate to the child
process once the browser state has returns to the top level.

## Prior Art

### [`vscDebugger`](https://github.com/ManuelHentschel/vscDebugger)

An existing implementation that originated as a VSCode extension.
While that package seems to work well in VSCode, it has been on
a long path to being more editor agnostic. `debugadapter` deviates from
the design choices of this package in two key ways:

- A pure R package for simpler portability
- Prioritzing a use case where an arbitrary terminal can be
  attached to the debug client and integrate with an interactive
  R session.
